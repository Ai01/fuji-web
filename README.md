# WebWand: Vision based Full Browser Automation ðŸª„

[Demo](https://twitter.com/mengdi_en/status/1721965940680565166)

WebWand uses [GPT-4 with vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf. Currently it allows you to define ad-hoc instructions. In the future it will also support saved and scheduled workflows.

WebWand's current status is **research preview**. Many workflows fail or confuse the agent. If you'd like to hack on WebWand to make it better or test it on your own workflows, follow the instructions below to run it locally.

You will need your own [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use WebWand.

WebWand only sends data to OpenAI's API. It does not send any data to third parties.

## Installing and Running

### Download and Install the extension in your browser

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/normal-computing/web-wand/releases), find the latest version of the extension and download "artifact.zip".
2. Unzip the file.
3. Load your extension on Chrome by doing the following:
   1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Toggle `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the unzipped folder

### Use the extension

*Please note that you might need to refresh the page for the extension to work.*

1. Find the WebWand icon in the top right corner of your browser and click on it to open the sidepanel.
2. The next thing you need to do is create or access an existing [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and paste it in the provided box. This key will be stored securely in your browser, and will not be uploaded to a third party.
3. Finally, navigate to a webpage you want WebWand and type in the task you want it to perform. For example, if you want to search for a movie on Google, you can type `Search for the movie Oblivion`. Then press `Enter` or click `Run` to execute the task.

### Build the extension

If you want to build the extension from source, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The developement was done on Node v20 but it should work with some lower versions.
2. Clone this repository
3. Install `pnpm` globally: `npm install -g pnpm` (check your node version >= 16.6, recommended >= 18)
4. Run `pnpm install` 
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

When loading the extension, you will need to load the `dist` folder.

## Credits

WebWand was inspired by and built on top of [TaxyAI's browser extension](https://github.com/TaxyAI/browser-extension), and reuses its UI and part of its action execution cycle code. 

The Chrome extension set-up leveraged an awesome boilerplate project [Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite).
